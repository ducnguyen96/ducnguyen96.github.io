    }
/>

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

### I.II. Feature Requirements - Gathering Process

**Question 1:**

We are tasked to design a Social Media System like Facebook.
In this system, different users can post media (text, images, videos) on their wall. Their friends can like or respond to those posts, as they see them.
The way we're going to monetize this platform is by allowing external advertisers to place ads which we will show on users' social media walls.

<MultipleChoiceQuestion
  question='Following the three step process to gather all the functional requirements, who are the (external) actors in this system?'
  options={
  [
    { id: "A", text: "Our Platform & The Social Medial Wall" },
    { id: "B", text: "Social Media Users & Advertisers", isCorrect: true },
    { id: "C", text: "Advertisers & Posts & Likes" },
  ]
    }
/>

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />


**Question 2:**

While designing an online store we created the following user flow using a sequence diagram:

import Userflow from "./images/user-flow.png"

<div style={{ 'textAlign': 'center' }}>
  <img src={Userflow} height="300"/>
</div>


<MultipleChoiceQuestion
  question='What is the use-case that this user-flow represents?'
  options={
  [
    { id: "A", text: "A merchant adding products to our online store" },
    { id: "B", text: "A driver making an delivery to a user" },
    { id: "C", text: "A user purchasing a product in our store", isCorrect: true },
  ]
    }
/>

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

### I.III. Quality Attribute Requirement

**Question 1:**

We have the following requirement:
**When a user is performing a search on our system, we need to return as many results as fast as possible.**

<MultipleChoiceQuestion
  question="What is the correct statement about that requirement?"
  options={
  [
    { id: "A", text: "This is a perfectly valid quality attribute requirement" },
    { id: "B", text: "This is not a good quality attribute requirement because it is not measurable", isCorrect: true },
    { id: "C", text: "This is not a good quality attribute requirement because it is not feasible" },
    { id: "D", text: "This is a perfectly valid functional requirement" }
  ]
    }
/>

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

**Question 2:**

We have the following requirement:

    { id: "C", text: "This is not a good quality attribute requirement because it is not feasible", isCorrect: true },
    { id: "D", text: "This is a perfectly valid functional requirement" }
  ]
    }
/>

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

### I.IV. System Constraints

**Question 1:**

While building our Multiplayer Online Game, we want to build our own proprietary **game engine**, to provide a better performance, optimized for our use case.

However, because of the strict deadline to release the game by the end of the year, we decided to go with an existing solution called Unreal Engine.

<MultipleChoiceQuestion
  question="What type of constraint made us change our original decision to build a proprietary game engine?"
  options={
  [
    { id: "A", text: "Technical Constraint" },
    { id: "B", text: "Business Constraint", isCorrect: true },
    { id: "C", text: "Legal Constraint" },
  ]
    }
/>

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

**Question 2:**

While designing our multiplayer online game we decided to use Cassandra database for storing the information about our users.

However, we couldn't find any engineers in our team who know how to work with Cassandra.

We later found out that all the teams in our company are using MongoDB. So we decided to use MongoDB for storing the users' information instead.

<MultipleChoiceQuestion
  question="What type of constraint made us choose MongoDB for our solution instead of Cassandra?"
  options={
  [
    { id: "A", text: "Technical Constraint", isCorrect: true },
    { id: "B", text: "Business Constraint" },
    { id: "C", text: "Legal Constraint" },

  ]
    }
/>

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

**Question 3:**

While designing a social media platform for sharing short videos with friends, we came up with the most optimal design and architecture.

However, before finalizing the design and starting the implementation we found out that **COPPA** (The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act), which is a law created to protect the privacy of children under 13, requires us to make significant changes to our design.

<MultipleChoiceQuestion
  question="What type of constraint required us to make changes in our original architecture?"
  options={
  [
    { id: "A", text: "Technical Constraint" },
    { id: "B", text: "Business Constraint" },
    { id: "C", text: "Legal Constraint", isCorrect: true },

  ]
    }
/>

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

## II. Most Important Quality Attributes 

### II.I. Performance


import Performance1 from "./images/performance1.png"
import Performance2 from "./images/performance2.png"
import Performance3 from "./images/performance3.png"

**Question 1:** 

We measured that the response time of our system as a function of load ( measured in thousands of requests per second) and came up with the following graph:

<div style={{ 'textAlign': 'center' }}>
  <img src={Performance1} height="300"/>
</div>


<MultipleChoiceQuestion
  question='What is the degradation point of our system?'
  options={
  [
    { id: "A", text: "Our system's degradation point is at 2k requests/sec" },
    { id: "B", text: "Our system's degradation point is at 10k requests/sec", isCorrect: true },
    { id: "C", text: "Our system's degradation point is at 12k requests/sec" },
    { id: "D", text: "Our system's degradation point is 100 ms" },
  ]
    }
/>

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />


**Question 2:**

We have the following response time distribution of 2 systems:

**System 1:**

<div style={{ 'textAlign': 'center' }}>
  <img src={Performance2} height="300"/>
</div>

**System 2:**

<div style={{ 'textAlign': 'center' }}>
  <img src={Performance3} height="300"/>
</div>

<MultipleChoiceQuestion
  question="Which system has a shorter/better tail latency?"
  options={
    [
      { id: "A", text: "System 1" },
      { id: "B", text: "System 2", isCorrect: true },
      { id: "C", text: "Both Systems has same tail latency" },
    ]
  }
/>

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

**Question 3:**


We are tasked to design a Video Transcoding and Compression as a Service System.
Our system will receive raw video files from clients (video streaming companies), and our job is to transcode the raw file into different video file formats for different devices as well as compress those files.

<MultipleChoiceQuestion

  options={
  [
    { id: "A", text: "Response time" },
    { id: "B", text: "Throughput", isCorrect: true },
    { id: "C", text: "Latency" },
    { id: "D", text: "Scalability" },
  ]
    }
/>

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

### II.II. Scalability


import Scalability1 from "./images/scalibility1.png"

**Question 1:** 

We have the following graph that illustrates the amount of work two systems can perform as a function of their resources:

<div style={{ 'textAlign': 'center' }}>
  <img src={Scalability1} height="300"/>
</div>


<MultipleChoiceQuestion
  question='Which system is more scalable?'
  options={
  [
    { id: "A", text: "System A", isCorrect: true },
    { id: "B", text: "System B" },
    { id: "C", text: "Both Systems are equally scalable" },
  ]
    }
/>

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

**Question 2:** 

Currently we are running our systems as 2 instances on 2 separate computers

To allow our system to take more requests from users, we decided to deploy our 2 application instances on a new type of machines that run twice as fast and have 3 times more memory.

<MultipleChoiceQuestion
  question='What type of scalability principle did we use?'
  options={
  [
    { id: "A", text: "Vertical Scalability", isCorrect: true },
    { id: "B", text: "Horizontal Scalability" },
    { id: "C", text: "Organizational Scalability" },
  ]
    }
/>

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

**Question 3:**

Currently, our entire system runs as a single service.

The codebase of that service became very large and complex, so we decided to break it into 2 separate services that we deploy as 2 separate groups of application instances.

<MultipleChoiceQuestion
  question='What scalability principle did we apply?'
  options={
  [
    { id: "A", text: "Vertical Scalability" },
    { id: "B", text: "Horizontal Scalability" },
    { id: "C", text: "Organizational Scalability", isCorrect: true },
  ]
    }
/>

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

**Question 4:**

We are designing a Video on Demand system that is estimated to double the number of active users, using our system every 3 months.

  question='What is the best scalability principle we should use, to make sure we keep up with the incoming traffic, and are able to provide all our users with good performance?'
  options={
  [
    { id: "A", text: "Vertical Scalability" },
    { id: "B", text: "Horizontal Scalability", isCorrect: true },
    { id: "C", text: "Vertical Scalability and Horizontal Scalability are equally good in the long run." },
  ]
    }
/>

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

### II.III. Availability

    { id: "C", text: "3.35%" },
    { id: "D", text: "94.7%" },
  ]
    }
/>

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

    { id: "C", text: "0.999999%" },
    { id: "D", text: "96%" },
  ]
    }
/>

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

**Question 3:**

<MultipleChoiceQuestion
  question="What is a potential risk of a prolonged outage of our mission critical system?"
  options={
  [
    { id: "A", text: "Loss of revenue" },
    { id: "B", text: "Loss of customers" },
    { id: "C", text: "Loss of life" },
    { id: "D", text: "All of the above", isCorrect: true },
  ]
    }
/>

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />


## III. API Design 

### III.I. Introduction 


**Question 1:**

<MultipleChoiceQuestion
  question='Which one of those operations is NOT idempotent?'
  options={
  [
    { id: "A", text: "Deleting a record with a particular ID from the database" },
    { id: "B", text: "Resetting the user's balance to 0" },
    { id: "C", text: "Taking the absolute value of a number" },
    { id: "D", text: "Removing the last record from a queue.", isCorrect: true },
  ]
    }
/>

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />


**Question 2:**

<MultipleChoiceQuestion
  question='When an API is offering Pagination. What are the 2 pieces of information, the user of the API needs to provide to the server as part of the request?'
  options={
  [
    { id: "A", text: "Client font size; Offset in the data set" },
    { id: "B", text: "The size of the client company; The client display resolution" },
    { id: "C", text: "Number of items in each response; Offset in the entire dataset", isCorrect: true },
  ]
    }
/>

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

**Question 3:**

<MultipleChoiceQuestion
  question='What is the problem we may run into if we do not explicitly version our external API?'
  options={
  [
    { id: "A", text: "We won't be able to change the implementation of the API" },
    { id: "B", text: "We won't be able to add features to the API" },
    { id: "C", text: "If we need to change our API in non-backwards compatible way will won't be able to make the change without breaking existing clients", isCorrect: true },
  ]
    }
/>

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

### III.II. Rest API 


**Question 1:**

We have the following resource in our online store:

    { id: "D", text: "All of the above", isCorrect: true },
  ]
    }
/>

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

**Question 2:**

Our company is currently offering a REST API to our users.

To reduce the overhead of authenticating a user against a database record, we are suggesting the following modification:

The user will be authenticated against the database only once, on the first request, and after that, the server in our system will cache the session information about the user in memory.

<MultipleChoiceQuestion
  question='What is the most correct statement?'
  options={
  [
    { id: "A", text: "Caching is one of the REST API concepts, so this solution will definitely keep our API RESTful" },
    { id: "B", text: "Our application instances now will maintain session information about users' requests and will no longer be stateless. So our API cannot be considered RESTful anymore", isCorrect: true },
    { id: "C", text: "This can introduce other performance issues and memory leaks. However, if we're very careful, we can avoid those problems. if we do, our API still can be considered RESTful" },
  ]
    }
/>

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

**Question 3:**

<MultipleChoiceQuestion
  question='Which one of the following operations is NOT a standard REST API operation'
  options={

    { id: "C", text: "Delete an existing resource" },
    { id: "D", text: "Modify 2 simple resources in one operation", isCorrect: true },
    { id: "E", text: "Get the state of a resource" },
  ]
    }
/>

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />



## IV. Building Blocks

### V.III. CAP Theorem

**Question 1:**

As part of our online bank system, we have a **CP** ( consistent and partition tolerant) distributed database that stores the account balance of all our clients.

To ensure we don't lose any data, we run 3 replicas of our database on different computers.

At a particular moment in time, our replicates contain the following information about a particular user:

- Replica 1: Account Balance = $100

- Replica 2: Account Balance = $100

- Replica 3: Account Balance = $100

All of a sudden, we have a thunderstorm, and one of our network switches breaks down, so **Replica 1** can no longer communicate with the rest of the replicas.

<MultipleChoiceQuestion
  question="What happens if a particular service is trying to communicate with Replica 1 to get the current user's balance?"
  options={
    [
      { id: "A", text: "All the replicas contain the same data, so Replica 1 can safely respond to the calling service with the value of $100" },
      { id: "B", text: "Since in the presence of a network partition our distributed database cannot safely guarantee consistency, it will return an error to the calling service", isCorrect: true },
      { id: "C", text: "Since in the presence of a network partition our distributed database cannot safely guarantee consistency, it will wait until the network partition is resolved and only then respond to the calling service." },
    ]
  }
/>

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

**Question 2:**

As part of our online bank system, we have an AP (available and partition tolerant) distributed database that stores the account balance of all our clients.

To ensure we don't lose any data, we run 3 replicas of our database on different computers.

At a particular moment in time, our replicas contain the following information about a particular user:

- Replica 1: Account Balance = $100

- Replica 2: Account Balance = $100

- Replica 3: Account Balance = $100

All of a sudden, we have a thunderstorm, and one of our network switches breaks down, so Replica 1 can no longer communicate with the rest of the replicas. 
Replicas 2 and 3 can continue to communicate with each other.
While the network switch is still broken, the user deposits another $50 dollars to their account, which goes through service A to Replica 2.

So the new picture of the replicas looks like this:
- Replica 1: Account Balance = $100

- Replica 2: Account Balance = $150

- Replica 3: Account Balance = $150

<MultipleChoiceQuestion
  question="What happens if service B is trying to communicate with our database to get the current user's balance?"
  options={
    [
      { id: "A", text: "It will definitely return the value of $100" },
      { id: "B", text: "It will definitely return the value of $150" },
      { id: "C", text: "It will most likely return $150 but may also return $100", isCorrect: true },
      { id: "D", text: "It will return an error because it doesn't know the most up-to-date value." },
    ]
  }
/>

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

**Question 3:**

<MultipleChoiceQuestion
  question="Can we have an Available and Consistent distributed database running on 3 replicas while still guaranteeing partition tolerance?"
  options={
    [
      { id: "A", text: "Yes" },
      { id: "B", text: "No", isCorrect: true },
    ]
  }
/>
